# HTML to React Converter

This project provides a serverless function that converts HTML to React JSX. It's designed to run on Vercel's serverless platform and can be easily deployed and integrated into your workflow.

It uses React for the frontend

## Features

- Converts basic HTML to JSX syntax
- Handles self-closing tags (e.g., `<img>`, `<br>`)
- Converts `class` attributes to `className`
- Converts `for` attributes to `htmlFor`
- Transforms inline styles to React style objects
- Wraps the converted HTML in a functional React component

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/teebarg/html-converter-app
   cd html-converter-app
   ```

2. Install the Vercel CLI if you haven't already:

   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. Deploy to Vercel:

   ```
   vercel
   ```

## Project Structure

- `./`: Frontend source code
- `api/hello.py`: The main Python function that handles the HTML to JSX conversion
- `vercel.json`: Configuration file for Vercel deployment
- `README.md`: This file

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
npm run dev
```

Your Python API is now available at `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Usage

To use the converter, send a POST request to your deployed Vercel function URL with the HTML content in the request body. The function will return a JavaScript file containing a React component.

Example using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '<div class="hello" style="color: red;">Hello, World!<img src="example.jpg" alt="Example"></div>' https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/convert
```

## Limitations

This is a basic converter and may not handle all complex HTML structures or React-specific features. It's designed for simple conversions and may need to be extended for more complex use cases.
